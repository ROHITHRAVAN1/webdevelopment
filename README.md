PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The project entitled Online Hotel Management is a web based system which
facilitates online information of hotel accommodations from anywhere in the
world. If a person wants to reserve his accommodation he would to know the
list of hotels in the city he wants to visit, different amenities provided in each
hotel the different types of rooms available, the rates of those rooms, the
constraints of the hotel and finally the availability of the desired rooms on the
desired rate.
He may achieve all this through travel agencies, the guides available, by making
enquiries in person, by making enquiries through telephone. If he wants to make
a choice between the hotels he has to repeat the whole process for a number of
hotels.
After being satisfied with the choice he has to confirm his reservation by paying
the amount personally or through middle persons. This process is laborious and
his choice is limited. So we found the necessity of providing all the information
and the facility to reserve his accommodation through the net so that maximum
satisfaction is achieved by the customer with least effort. The solution we are 
providing to this is to design a website that contains information about various
cities and the reputed hotels in each city along with the facilities, types of rooms
and their rates. The tourist can also choose the hotel of his interest.
